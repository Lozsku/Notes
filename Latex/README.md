# Interview-Prep — LaTeX Edition

Professional, book-quality LaTeX typesetting of every note in `../Interview-Prep`,
with compiled PDFs. Each markdown topic becomes one styled `.tex` source and one PDF.

## What's here

```

```

Key outputs in `pdf/`:
- One PDF per topic (e.g. `01-concurrency.pdf`, `aiml-04-tf.pdf`, …) — **27 editions**.
- `00-Collection-Index.pdf` — cover + catalogue of all editions.
- `Complete-Collection.pdf` — every edition merged into one ~790-page book, with a full
  **PDF bookmark tree** (per-edition entries + nested sections) for navigation.

And `anki/` holds **flashcards** auto-generated from the Q&A sections — `ALL-flashcards.tsv`
plus one `.tsv` per topic, importable straight into Anki (see `anki/README.md`).

## Toolchain (no root / no system install required)

- **pandoc** (`~/.local/bin/pandoc`) — markdown → LaTeX.
- **Tectonic** (`~/.local/bin/tectonic`) — self-contained XeTeX engine; fetches and
  caches only the LaTeX packages it needs (no multi-GB TeX Live install).
- **matplotlib / pypdfium2** (already in the user's Python) — diagrams & PDF merge.
- Fonts: premium set installed to `~/.fonts` — body **IBM Plex Serif**, headings **Inter**,
  code **JetBrains Mono** (covers box-drawing glyphs for ASCII diagrams). Falls back to
  Liberation/Ubuntu/DejaVu if those aren't present.
- **pypdf** (merged-book bookmarks) — `pip install pypdf` if missing.

## Rebuild / resume

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
cd Latex
python3 build.py            # build everything stale (skips up-to-date docs)
python3 build.py --force    # rebuild all
python3 build.py --only 04  # only docs whose key contains "04"
python3 build.py --status   # progress table
python3 make_index.py       # rebuild the index + bookmarked merged collection
python3 make_anki.py        # regenerate the Anki flashcard decks
```

The build is **resumable**: `manifest.json` records each source's content hash and
whether its PDF compiled. Re-running rebuilds only what changed (source edits, or any
change to the style/template/filter). It checkpoints after every document, so an
interrupted run continues from where it stopped.

## Design notes

- The look is defined entirely in `assets/interviewstyle.sty`: per-topic accent color,
  colored section bars, **macOS-terminal-style code cards** (dark window with red/yellow/
  green traffic-light dots, syntax highlighting, and the **language shown top-right** via
  `assets/codelang.lua`), callout boxes for blockquotes, proportional booktabs tables, a
  TikZ cover page, and running headers.
- Headings are shifted up one level (`--shift-heading-level-by=-1`): the H1 doc title
  (already on the cover) is dropped, H2→numbered section, H3→subsection, so the TOC
  (`tocdepth=2`) shows full `1.1 / 1.2` detail.
- Untagged ` ``` ` code fences that are clearly code (not ASCII diagrams) are auto-tagged
  with a **guessed language** (`_guess_lang`/`_autolang` in `build.py`) so they get
  IDE-style highlighting instead of plain verbatim; box-drawing diagrams stay in the light
  card. Long code lines **wrap** (via `fvextra`) and carry a faint **line-number gutter**.
- Tables get a **tinted header row** + **zebra striping** (`_style_tables` in `build.py`),
  and inline `§N` references become **clickable** links to that section.
- The merged `Complete-Collection.pdf` is assembled with **pypdf** (`make_index.py`), which
  preserves each edition's internal bookmarks and nests them under a per-edition entry.
- **29 diagrams across 23 editions** (`diagrams.py` → vector PDFs in `figures/`), embedded
  as a per-topic "Visual Reference" section: architecture box-diagrams, sequence diagrams
  (TLS), class diagrams (Strategy/Observer), heatmaps (isolation levels, DS complexity),
  and plots (Amdahl, bias–variance, ROC, gradient descent, latency ladder, CAP, …). Each
  figure is themed to its edition's accent color.
- Unicode in prose (arrows, Greek, math operators, ✓/✗) is converted to real LaTeX math
  during preprocessing (see `SYM` in `build.py`), because the body serif has no glyphs
  for them and XeTeX does no automatic font fallback. Inside code/diagram blocks the
  original characters are kept (DejaVu Mono renders them).
- ASCII diagrams render inside a light monospace "diagram card". Topics where a real
  plot is clearer can get matplotlib/TikZ figures under `figures/` (see `diagrams.py`).

## Per-topic accent / theme

Themes (title, track, number, colors) are defined in the `REG` table at the top of
`build.py`. Edit there to change a topic's title, ordering, or color.
